# Pomodoro Timer project
> Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique created by Francesco Cirillo for a more productive way to work
and study. It consists of the following steps:
- Set the Pomodoro timer (25 mins)
- Work on the task
- Take a Short Break (5 mins)
- Every four "pomodoros", take a Long Break

This is a Pomodoro Timer implementation that helps you to use the technique.
